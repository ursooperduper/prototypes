Apple's Wallet app is very simple, but I really enjoy the smoothness of its interaction. This prototype replicates that interaction with a simple card animation that pops up when tapped, while all other cards drop to the bottom of the screen.

A good next step for this prototype would be to implement the card flip for more information.
